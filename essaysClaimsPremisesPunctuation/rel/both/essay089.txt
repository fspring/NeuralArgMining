Nowadays	(O,|)
there	(O,|)
are	(O,|)
some	(O,|)
issues	(O,|)
which	(O,|)
many	(O,|)
countries	(O,|)
and	(O,|)
nations	(O,|)
are	(O,|)
concern	(O,|)
about	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
Two	(O,|)
of	(O,|)
the	(O,|)
most	(O,|)
important	(O,|)
of	(O,|)
them	(O,|)
are	(O,|)
rate	(O,|)
of	(O,|)
increasing	(O,|)
population	(O,|)
and	(O,|)
endangered	(O,|)
plants	(O,|)
and	(O,|)
animals	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
From	(O,|)
my	(O,|)
point	(O,|)
of	(O,|)
view	(O,|)
although	(O,|)
endangered	(C,0)
animals	(I,0)
are	(I,0)
important	(I,0)
,	(O,|)
human	(C,9)
needs	(I,8)
should	(I,7)
be	(I,6)
considered	(I,5)
more	(I,4)
.	(O,|)
Firstly	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
day	(P,8)
by	(I,7)
day	(I,6)
population	(I,5)
is	(I,4)
increasing	(I,3)
,	(O,|)
so	(O,|)
human	(P,40)
needs	(I,39)
for	(I,38)
food	(I,37)
is	(I,36)
increasing	(I,35)
as	(I,34)
well	(I,33)
.	(O,|)
We	(P,31)
need	(I,30)
farmland	(I,29)
to	(I,28)
grow	(I,27)
crops	(I,26)
such	(I,25)
as	(I,24)
wheat	(I,23)
and	(I,22)
corn	(I,21)
,	(I,20)
and	(I,19)
there	(I,18)
is	(I,17)
no	(I,16)
doubt	(I,15)
that	(I,14)
without	(I,13)
food	(I,12)
people	(I,11)
cannot	(I,10)
alive	(I,9)
for	(I,8)
more	(I,7)
than	(I,6)
some	(I,5)
weeks	(I,4)
.	(O,|)
Therefore	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
farmlands	(C,0)
are	(I,0)
vital	(I,0)
for	(I,0)
human	(I,0)
life	(I,0)
.	(O,|)
Secondly	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
people	(P,19)
need	(I,18)
shelters	(I,17)
to	(I,16)
protect	(I,15)
themselves	(I,14)
from	(I,13)
mother	(I,12)
nature	(I,11)
such	(I,10)
as	(I,9)
wind	(I,8)
and	(I,7)
flood	(I,6)
and	(I,5)
wild	(I,4)
animals	(I,3)
,	(O,|)
so	(O,|)
they	(C,10)
need	(I,9)
land	(I,8)
to	(I,7)
build	(I,6)
their	(I,5)
houses	(I,4)
on	(I,3)
it	(I,2)
.	(O,|)
Dwelling	(P,91)
is	(I,90)
one	(I,89)
of	(I,88)
the	(I,87)
most	(I,86)
important	(I,85)
human	(I,84)
needs	(I,83)
after	(I,82)
food	(I,81)
which	(I,80)
is	(I,79)
undeniable	(I,78)
.	(O,|)
Finally	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
human	(P,22)
need	(I,21)
some	(I,20)
crucial	(I,19)
things	(I,18)
to	(I,17)
continue	(I,16)
their	(I,15)
life	(I,14)
,	(I,13)
and	(I,12)
most	(I,11)
of	(I,10)
them	(I,9)
are	(I,8)
industrial	(I,7)
such	(I,6)
as	(I,5)
medicine	(I,4)
.	(O,|)
Therefore	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
some	(C,8)
lands	(I,7)
should	(I,6)
be	(I,5)
assigned	(I,4)
to	(I,3)
industry	(I,2)
.	(O,|)
Todays	(P,44)
life	(I,43)
has	(I,42)
some	(I,41)
difficulty	(I,40)
which	(I,39)
become	(I,38)
comfortable	(I,37)
with	(I,36)
the	(I,35)
help	(I,34)
of	(I,33)
industry	(I,32)
.	(O,|)
To	(O,|)
conclude	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
the	(P,12)
population	(I,11)
of	(I,10)
endangered	(I,9)
animals	(I,8)
are	(I,7)
less	(I,6)
than	(I,5)
people's	(I,4)
population	(I,3)
,	(O,|)
so	(O,|)
they	(C,0)
do	(I,0)
not	(I,0)
need	(I,0)
so	(I,0)
much	(I,0)
land	(I,0)
that	(I,0)
people	(I,0)
need	(I,0)
.	(O,|)
I	(O,|)
would	(O,|)
maintain	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
nowadays	(C,0)
humans	(I,0)
need	(I,0)
farmland	(I,0)
,	(I,0)
housing	(I,0)
and	(I,0)
industry	(I,0)
because	(O,|)
of	(O,|)
increasing	(C,0)
population	(I,0)
are	(I,0)
more	(I,0)
important	(I,0)
than	(I,0)
saving	(I,0)
land	(I,0)
for	(I,0)
endangered	(I,0)
animals	(I,0)

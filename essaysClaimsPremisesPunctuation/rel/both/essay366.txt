First	(O,|)
of	(O,|)
all	(O,|)
,	(O,|)

Many	(P,184)
young	(I,183)
people	(I,182)
indulge	(I,181)
themselves	(I,180)
in	(I,179)
drugs	(I,178)

smoking	(I,175)
at	(I,174)
an	(I,173)
early	(I,172)
age	(I,171)
.	(O,|)
For	(O,|)
example	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
in	(P,166)
a	(I,165)
survey	(I,164)
carried	(I,163)
out	(I,162)
in	(I,161)
a	(I,160)
university	(I,159)
,	(I,158)
it	(I,157)
was	(I,156)
asked	(I,155)
to	(I,154)
students	(I,153)
that	(I,152)
why	(I,151)
did	(I,150)
they	(I,149)
start	(I,148)
smoking	(I,147)
,	(I,146)
then	(I,145)
around	(I,144)
forty	(I,143)
percent	(I,142)
of	(I,141)

wanted	(I,136)
to	(I,135)
look	(I,134)
like	(I,133)
their	(I,132)
favorite	(I,131)
screen	(I,130)
actor	(I,129)
while	(I,128)
smoking	(I,127)
cigarettes	(I,126)
.	(O,|)
This	(O,|)
example	(O,|)
makes	(O,|)
it	(O,|)
clear	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
imitating	(P,118)
celebrities	(I,117)
has	(I,116)
a	(I,115)
negative	(I,114)
influence	(I,113)
on	(I,112)
health	(I,111)
of	(I,110)
young	(I,109)
individuals	(I,108)
.	(O,|)
Secondly	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
it	(O,|)
is	(O,|)
believed	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
when	(P,77)
youth	(I,76)
follows	(I,75)
celebrities	(I,74)
it	(I,73)
affects	(I,72)
personality	(I,71)
of	(I,70)
young	(I,69)
people	(I,68)
in	(I,67)
a	(I,66)
bad	(I,65)
way	(I,64)
.	(O,|)
Adolescents	(P,62)
follow	(I,61)
not	(I,60)
only	(I,59)
the	(I,58)
make	(I,57)
up	(I,56)
and	(I,55)
attire	(I,54)
of	(I,53)
their	(I,52)
favorite	(I,51)
stars	(I,50)
but	(I,49)
also	(I,48)
their	(I,47)
behavior	(I,46)
.	(O,|)
For	(O,|)
instance	(O,|)
recently	(P,42)
in	(I,41)
a	(I,40)
poll	(I,39)
conducted	(I,38)
by	(I,37)
an	(I,36)
American	(I,35)
magazine	(I,34)
it	(I,33)
was	(I,32)
found	(I,31)
that	(I,30)
most	(I,29)
of	(I,28)
the	(I,27)
parents	(I,26)
and	(I,25)
teachers	(I,24)
complain	(I,23)
that	(I,22)
teenagers	(I,21)
use	(I,20)
derogatory	(I,19)
words	(I,18)
and	(I,17)
abusive	(I,16)
language	(I,15)
at	(I,14)
home	(I,13)
and	(I,12)
at	(I,11)
schools	(I,10)
.	(O,|)
So	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
this	(O,|)
example	(O,|)
makes	(O,|)
it	(O,|)
obvious	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
these	(C,0)
glamorous	(I,0)
celebrities	(I,0)
have	(I,0)
a	(I,0)
poor	(I,0)
effect	(I,0)
on	(I,0)
the	(I,0)
conduct	(I,0)
of	(I,0)
young	(I,0)
people	(I,0)
.	(O,|)
Thus	(O,|)
to	(O,|)
conclude	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
it	(O,|)
can	(O,|)
be	(O,|)
said	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
when	(C,0)
young	(I,0)
people	(I,0)
follow	(I,0)
celebrities	(I,0)
,	(I,0)
it	(I,0)
affects	(I,0)
their	(I,0)
health	(I,0)
as	(I,0)
well	(I,0)
as	(I,0)
behavior	(I,0)
in	(I,0)
a	(I,0)
negative	(I,0)
way	(I,0)
.	(O,|)
This	(C,0)
has	(I,0)
an	(I,0)
overall	(I,0)
effect	(I,0)
on	(I,0)
personality	(I,0)
and	(I,0)
future	(I,0)
of	(I,0)
an	(I,0)
individual	(I,0)
.	(O,|)
Therefore	(O,|)
it	(O,|)
is	(O,|)
recommended	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
young	(O,|)
people	(O,|)
should	(O,|)
be	(O,|)
educated	(O,|)
not	(O,|)
to	(O,|)
follow	(O,|)
these	(O,|)
celebrities	(O,|)
blindly	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
rather	(O,|)
they	(O,|)
should	(O,|)
focus	(O,|)
on	(O,|)
their	(O,|)
career	(O,|)
so	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
they	(O,|)
may	(O,|)
hope	(O,|)

Nowdays	(O,|)

entertain	(O,|)

One	(O,|)
of	(O,|)
this	(O,|)

Therefore	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
I	(O,|)
agree	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
Television	(C,49)
has	(I,48)
destroyed	(I,47)
communication	(I,46)

some	(C,10)

I	(P,269)
know	(I,268)
someone	(I,267)

wakes	(I,265)
up	(I,264)

Sometimes	(P,238)
his	(I,237)

wants	(I,235)

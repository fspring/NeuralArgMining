primary	(O,|)
factors	(O,|)

we	(O,|)
basically	(O,|)
consider	(O,|)
before	(O,|)
we	(O,|)
decide	(O,|)
to	(O,|)
live	(O,|)
in	(O,|)
a	(O,|)
place	(O,|)

However	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
it	(O,|)
is	(O,|)
difficult	(O,|)
to	(O,|)
find	(O,|)
a	(O,|)

can	(O,|)
perfectly	(O,|)
meet	(O,|)

In	(O,|)
my	(O,|)

there	(O,|)
are	(O,|)
almost	(O,|)
complete	(O,|)
public	(O,|)
utilities	(O,|)
for	(O,|)
one’s	(O,|)
needs	(O,|)
but	(O,|)
transportation	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
So	(O,|)
the	(C,57)
thing	(I,56)
that	(I,55)
I	(I,54)
really	(I,53)
want	(I,52)
to	(I,51)
change	(I,50)

to	(I,48)
have	(I,47)

Since	(O,|)
I’m	(C,0)
facing	(I,0)
the	(I,0)

every	(I,0)

.	(O,|)
And	(O,|)
this	(O,|)
problem	(O,|)
seem	(O,|)
to	(O,|)
get	(O,|)
worst	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
At	(O,|)
first	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
it	(C,22)
should	(I,21)
have	(I,20)

Since	(O,|)
now	(P,13)

a	(I,9)

First	(O,|)
and	(O,|)
foremost	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
I	(O,|)
believe	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
it	(C,26)
would	(I,25)
be	(I,24)
easier	(I,23)
for	(I,22)
the	(I,21)
juries	(I,20)
to	(I,19)
make	(I,18)
a	(I,17)
decision	(I,16)
if	(I,15)
they	(I,14)
know	(I,13)
about	(I,12)

This	(O,|)
is	(O,|)
because	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
knowing	(P,23)
their	(I,22)
background	(I,21)
very	(I,20)
well	(I,19)
will	(I,18)
enable	(I,17)
the	(I,16)
juries	(I,15)
to	(I,14)
analyze	(I,13)
the	(I,12)
crime	(I,11)
before	(I,10)

up	(I,8)
with	(I,7)
a	(I,6)
judgment	(I,5)
.	(O,|)
For	(O,|)
instance	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
take	(P,245)
a	(I,244)
person	(I,243)
who	(I,242)
has	(I,241)
not	(I,240)

is	(I,236)
suddenly	(I,235)
found	(I,234)
to	(I,233)
be	(I,232)
guilty	(I,231)

The	(P,229)
juries	(I,228)

the	(I,209)
facts	(I,208)
about	(I,207)
the	(I,206)
person	(I,205)
.	(O,|)
Then	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
punishment	(P,201)
can	(I,200)
be	(I,199)
given	(I,198)
in	(I,197)

Apart	(O,|)

a	(P,92)
fair	(I,91)
trial	(I,90)
can	(I,89)
be	(I,88)

As	(O,|)
all	(O,|)

us	(O,|)
know	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
juries	(P,17)
are	(I,16)

Thus	(O,|)

the	(I,59)
past	(I,58)

them	(I,51)

By	(O,|)

the	(P,26)

Nowadays	(O,|)

many	(O,|)
technology	(O,|)

as	(O,|)
Tv	(O,|)

Many	(O,|)
people	(O,|)
say	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
television	(O,|)
has	(O,|)
negative	(O,|)
effects	(O,|)
on	(O,|)
children	(O,|)

since	(O,|)
it	(O,|)

be	(O,|)
violent	(O,|)

inappropriate	(O,|)
for	(O,|)
children	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
However	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
I	(O,|)
strongly	(O,|)
believe	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
television	(C,29)
has	(I,28)
more	(I,27)
positive	(I,26)
effects	(I,25)

There	(O,|)
are	(O,|)
two	(O,|)
reasons	(O,|)
to	(O,|)
support	(O,|)
my	(O,|)
idea	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
First	(O,|)
of	(O,|)
all	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
television	(C,7)
has	(I,6)
useful	(I,5)

educational	(I,3)
programs	(I,2)

Not	(P,265)

but	(I,259)
also	(I,258)
there	(I,257)
are	(I,256)
many	(I,255)
programs	(I,254)
which	(I,253)
has	(I,252)
educational	(I,251)
purposes	(I,250)
.	(O,|)
If	(P,248)
children	(I,247)
can	(I,246)
use	(I,245)
those	(I,244)
programs	(I,243)

they	(I,240)
can	(I,239)
learn	(I,238)
many	(I,237)

For	(O,|)

in	(P,229)
Korea	(I,228)

We	(P,213)

Also	(O,|)

In	(O,|)

Tv	(C,18)

Many	(P,149)

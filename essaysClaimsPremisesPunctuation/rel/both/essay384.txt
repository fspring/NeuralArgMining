Reducing	(O,|)

Personally	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
I	(O,|)
believe	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
governments	(C,33)
should	(I,32)
definitely	(I,31)
reduce	(I,30)

for	(I,12)
mature	(I,11)

would	(I,7)
be	(I,6)
entirely	(I,5)
reasonable	(I,4)
.	(O,|)
Admittedly	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
reducing	(P,97)
the	(I,96)
proportion	(I,95)
of	(I,94)
violent	(I,93)

However	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
in	(O,|)
order	(O,|)
to	(O,|)
tackle	(O,|)
this	(O,|)
problem	(O,|)
more	(O,|)
effectively	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
governments	(P,65)
must	(I,64)
first	(I,63)
prohibit	(I,62)
any	(I,61)
types	(I,60)

As	(P,50)
a	(I,49)
result	(I,48)
of	(I,47)
mental	(I,46)

most	(I,43)

distinguishing	(I,38)

.	(O,|)
Little	(O,|)
wonder	(O,|)

then	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
by	(P,27)

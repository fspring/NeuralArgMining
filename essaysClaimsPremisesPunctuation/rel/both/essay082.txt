it	(O,|)
is	(O,|)
generally	(O,|)
understood	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
advertising	(P,21)

promoting	(I,12)

Advertisements	(C,0)

for	(I,0)
many	(I,0)
businesses	(I,0)

Also	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
to	(C,30)
consumers	(I,29)

can	(I,26)
bring	(I,25)
them	(I,24)

For	(O,|)
example	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
customers	(P,17)
of	(I,16)
telecommunication	(I,15)
services	(I,14)
will	(I,13)

an	(I,11)
idea	(I,10)
about	(I,9)
the	(I,8)
current	(I,7)
offers	(I,6)
of	(I,5)
different	(I,4)
companies	(I,3)

hence	(O,|)
they	(P,173)
can	(I,172)
compare	(I,171)
them	(I,170)
and	(I,169)
then	(I,168)
have	(I,167)
a	(I,166)
better	(I,165)
decision	(I,164)

From	(O,|)
all	(O,|)
of	(O,|)
these	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
it	(O,|)
is	(O,|)
easy	(O,|)
to	(O,|)
see	(O,|)
why	(O,|)
the	(O,|)
idea	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
advertising	(O,|)
is	(O,|)
a	(O,|)
positive	(O,|)
part	(O,|)
of	(O,|)
life	(O,|)
will	(O,|)
garner	(O,|)
strong	(O,|)

However	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
it	(O,|)
can	(O,|)
be	(O,|)
seen	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
some	(O,|)
people	(O,|)
have	(O,|)
argued	(O,|)
against	(O,|)
advertising	(O,|)
due	(O,|)
to	(O,|)
its	(O,|)
negative	(O,|)
impacts	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
Firstly	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
a	(C,0)
huge	(I,0)
amount	(I,0)
of	(I,0)
different	(I,0)
advertisements	(I,0)
could	(I,0)
be	(I,0)
sent	(I,0)
automatically	(I,0)
by	(I,0)
a	(I,0)
system	(I,0)

email	(I,0)

this	(I,0)
is	(I,0)
generally	(I,0)
known	(I,0)
as	(I,0)
spam	(I,0)

and	(I,0)
causes	(I,0)
discomfort	(I,0)
or	(I,0)
even	(I,0)
annoyance	(I,0)
to	(I,0)
many	(I,0)
people	(I,0)
.	(O,|)
Secondly	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
advertising	(P,21)
can	(I,20)
be	(I,19)
very	(I,18)
expensive	(I,17)
and	(I,16)
not	(I,15)
every	(I,14)
advertising	(I,13)
campaign	(I,12)
can	(I,11)
be	(I,10)
done	(I,9)
successfully	(I,8)
and	(I,7)
brings	(I,6)
good	(I,5)
results	(I,4)

Therefore	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
advertising	(C,0)
is	(I,0)
believed	(I,0)
by	(I,0)
many	(I,0)

a	(I,0)
financial	(I,0)
burden	(I,0)
to	(I,0)
businesses	(I,0)

In	(O,|)
conclusion	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
after	(O,|)
analyzing	(O,|)
the	(O,|)
pros	(O,|)
and	(O,|)
cons	(O,|)
of	(O,|)
advertising	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
both	(O,|)
of	(O,|)
the	(O,|)
views	(O,|)
have	(O,|)
strong	(O,|)
support	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
but	(O,|)
it	(O,|)
is	(O,|)
felt	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
more	(C,0)
good	(I,0)
comes	(I,0)
from	(I,0)
advertising	(I,0)
than	(I,0)
bad	(I,0)
.	(O,|)
Thus	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
the	(C,0)
idea	(I,0)
that	(I,0)
advertising	(I,0)
is	(I,0)
a	(I,0)

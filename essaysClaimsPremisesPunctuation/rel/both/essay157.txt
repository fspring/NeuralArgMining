Nowadays	(O,|)
information	(O,|)
plays	(O,|)
an	(O,|)
important	(O,|)
role	(O,|)
in	(O,|)
our	(O,|)
world	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
It	(O,|)
has	(O,|)
become	(O,|)
a	(O,|)
product	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
which	(O,|)
can	(O,|)
be	(O,|)
sold	(O,|)

bought	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
or	(O,|)
stolen	(O,|)

Some	(O,|)
people	(O,|)
say	(O,|)
:	(O,|)
"information	(O,|)
is	(O,|)
power"	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
That's	(O,|)
why	(O,|)
it	(O,|)
is	(O,|)
so	(O,|)
important	(O,|)
to	(O,|)
be	(O,|)
well-informed	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
I	(O,|)
consider	(O,|)
the	(O,|)
statement	(O,|)
above	(O,|)
to	(O,|)
be	(O,|)
right	(O,|)
for	(O,|)
several	(O,|)
reasons	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
The	(O,|)
first	(O,|)
reason	(O,|)
is	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
by	(C,12)
using	(I,11)
different	(I,10)
sources	(I,9)
of	(I,8)
information	(I,7)
we	(I,6)
can	(I,5)
guarantee	(I,4)
its	(I,3)
reliability	(I,2)
.	(O,|)
Some	(P,232)
people	(I,231)
may	(I,230)
disinform	(I,229)
you	(I,228)
on	(I,227)
purpose	(I,226)
,	(I,225)
that's	(I,224)
why	(I,223)
it	(I,222)
is	(I,221)
rather	(I,220)
unwise	(I,219)
to	(I,218)
make	(I,217)
conclusions	(I,216)
before	(I,215)
you	(I,214)
are	(I,213)
confident	(I,212)
of	(I,211)
the	(I,210)
information	(I,209)
.	(O,|)
For	(O,|)
example	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
Russian	(P,204)
news	(I,203)

After	(P,176)
a	(I,175)
while	(I,174)
the	(I,173)
situation	(I,172)
became	(I,171)
clear	(I,170)

but	(I,168)
before	(I,167)
that	(I,166)
a	(I,165)
lot	(I,164)
of	(I,163)
people	(I,162)
had	(I,161)
already	(I,160)
condemned	(I,159)
the	(I,158)
actions	(I,157)
of	(I,156)
Russia	(I,155)
.	(O,|)
Secondly	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
it	(P,49)
is	(I,48)
very	(I,47)
important	(I,46)
to	(I,45)

facts	(I,43)
about	(I,42)
some	(I,41)
events	(I,40)

problem	(I,38)

only	(I,35)
estimations	(I,34)

because	(O,|)
it	(P,31)

help	(I,29)
you	(I,28)
to	(I,27)

conclusion	(I,23)

Sometimes	(O,|)
it	(O,|)
can	(O,|)
be	(O,|)
really	(O,|)
difficult	(O,|)
to	(O,|)
find	(O,|)
out	(O,|)
the	(O,|)
facts	(O,|)

in	(O,|)
the	(O,|)
internet	(O,|)

that's	(O,|)
why	(O,|)
you	(C,16)
have	(I,15)
to	(I,14)
look	(I,13)
through	(I,12)
different	(I,11)
sources	(I,10)
before	(I,9)
you	(I,8)
manage	(I,7)
to	(I,6)
find	(I,5)
some	(I,4)

It	(P,86)
is	(I,85)
possible	(I,84)
to	(I,83)
make	(I,82)
a	(I,81)
wrong	(I,80)
decision	(I,79)
because	(O,|)
you	(P,77)
have	(I,76)
just	(I,75)
used	(I,74)
someone's	(I,73)
personal	(I,72)

it	(I,63)
was	(I,62)

For	(O,|)
example	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
several	(P,55)
years	(I,54)
ago	(I,53)
in	(I,52)
Moscow	(I,51)
salt	(I,50)

two	(I,48)
times	(I,47)

expensive	(I,45)
only	(I,44)
in	(I,43)
one	(I,42)
week	(I,41)

because	(I,39)
people	(I,38)
thought	(I,37)

prices	(I,19)

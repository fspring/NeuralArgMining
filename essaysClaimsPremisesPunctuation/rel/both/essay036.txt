Gun	(O,|)

definitely	(O,|)
not	(O,|)
a	(O,|)
kind	(O,|)
of	(O,|)
normal	(O,|)
good	(O,|)
in	(O,|)
our	(O,|)
society	(O,|)

is	(O,|)
strictly	(O,|)

However	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
gun	(O,|)
control	(O,|)
in	(O,|)
some	(O,|)
countries	(O,|)
is	(O,|)
relatively	(O,|)
loose	(O,|)

Therefore	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
this	(O,|)
is	(O,|)
still	(O,|)
a	(O,|)
controversial	(O,|)
topic	(O,|)
around	(O,|)
the	(O,|)
world	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
From	(O,|)
my	(O,|)
point	(O,|)
of	(O,|)
view	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
it	(C,21)
is	(I,20)
sensible	(I,19)
to	(I,18)
enforce	(I,17)
the	(I,16)
gun	(I,15)
control	(I,14)
.	(O,|)
The	(O,|)
first	(O,|)
factor	(O,|)
considered	(O,|)
is	(O,|)
the	(O,|)
risk	(O,|)
of	(O,|)
accidents	(O,|)
with	(O,|)
guns	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
The	(P,39)
accidents	(I,38)
cannot	(I,37)
be	(I,36)
completely	(I,35)
avoided	(I,34)
although	(I,33)
only	(I,32)
those	(I,31)
who	(I,30)
have	(I,29)
gun	(I,28)
licenses	(I,27)
can	(I,26)
purchase	(I,25)
guns	(I,24)
.	(O,|)
For	(O,|)
example	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
we	(P,19)
hear	(I,18)
some	(I,17)
news	(I,16)
from	(I,15)
time	(I,14)
to	(I,13)
time	(I,12)
that	(I,11)
someone	(I,10)
was	(I,9)
hurt	(I,8)
by	(I,7)
accident	(I,6)
during	(I,5)
the	(I,4)
hunting	(I,3)
.	(O,|)
So	(O,|)
the	(C,0)
fewer	(I,0)
guns	(I,0)
possessed	(I,0)
,	(I,0)
the	(I,0)
fewer	(I,0)
accidents	(I,0)

our	(I,0)

be	(I,0)
safer	(I,0)
with	(I,0)

rates	(I,0)
.	(O,|)
Secondly	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
most	(C,24)
violent	(I,23)
crimes	(I,22)
are	(I,21)
related	(I,20)
to	(I,19)
the	(I,18)
abuse	(I,17)
of	(I,16)
guns	(I,15)
,	(I,14)
especially	(I,13)
in	(I,12)
some	(I,11)
countries	(I,10)
where	(I,9)
guns	(I,8)
are	(I,7)
available	(I,6)
for	(I,5)
people	(I,4)
.	(O,|)
Eventually	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
guns	(P,137)
will	(I,136)
create	(I,135)
a	(I,134)
violent	(I,133)
society	(I,132)
if	(I,131)
the	(I,130)
trend	(I,129)
continues	(I,128)

Take	(O,|)
an	(O,|)
example	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
in	(P,122)
American	(I,121)

young	(I,119)
adults	(I,118)

get	(I,113)
access	(I,112)

to	(I,106)
the	(I,105)
tragedies	(I,104)
of	(I,103)
school	(I,102)

What	(O,|)
is	(O,|)
worse	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
some	(P,94)
terrorists	(I,93)
are	(I,92)
able	(I,91)
to	(I,90)
possess	(I,89)

in	(I,76)
danger	(I,75)
.	(O,|)
Thirdly	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
the	(C,12)
possession	(I,11)
of	(I,10)
guns	(I,9)
can	(I,8)
also	(I,7)
raise	(I,6)

Unfortunately	(O,|)

gap	(O,|)
between	(O,|)

developing	(O,|)
countries	(O,|)

It	(O,|)
can	(O,|)
be	(O,|)
seen	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
some	(O,|)
developed	(O,|)

However	(O,|)

it	(C,38)

be	(I,32)

way	(I,27)
to	(I,26)

developing	(I,24)

This	(O,|)
will	(O,|)
be	(O,|)
proven	(O,|)
by	(O,|)
analyzing	(O,|)
the	(O,|)
necessity	(O,|)
of	(O,|)
developing	(O,|)
their	(O,|)
education	(O,|)
and	(O,|)
the	(O,|)
real	(O,|)

of	(O,|)
supporters	(O,|)

Firstly	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
education	(P,47)
is	(I,46)
an	(I,45)
essential	(I,44)
part	(I,43)
in	(I,42)
development	(I,41)
.	(O,|)
For	(O,|)
instance	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
most	(P,36)
developing	(I,35)
countries	(I,34)
are	(I,33)
lack	(I,32)
of	(I,31)
educational	(I,30)
resources	(I,29)
,	(I,28)
such	(I,27)
as	(I,26)
experienced	(I,25)
teachers	(I,24)
,	(I,23)
evaluation	(I,22)
systems	(I,21)
and	(I,20)
teaching	(I,19)
facilities	(I,18)
,	(I,17)
which	(I,16)
is	(I,15)
usually	(I,14)
neglected	(I,13)
by	(I,12)
local	(I,11)
authorities	(I,10)
.	(O,|)
From	(O,|)
this	(O,|)
example	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
it	(O,|)
is	(O,|)
obvious	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
if	(C,34)
the	(I,33)
developed	(I,32)
countries	(I,31)
are	(I,30)
unwilling	(I,29)
to	(I,28)
share	(I,27)
their	(I,26)
successful	(I,25)
experience	(I,24)
in	(I,23)
education	(I,22)

the	(I,20)
developing	(I,19)
countries	(I,18)

remain	(I,16)
undeveloped	(I,15)

even	(I,13)
though	(I,12)
they	(I,11)
gain	(I,10)
a	(I,9)
great	(I,8)
deal	(I,7)
of	(I,6)
economic	(I,5)
support	(I,4)

Thus	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
the	(P,106)
critical	(I,105)
method	(I,104)
to	(I,103)
improve	(I,102)
the	(I,101)
condition	(I,100)
of	(I,99)
poor	(I,98)
countries	(I,97)
is	(I,96)
to	(I,95)
help	(I,94)
them	(I,93)
build	(I,92)
up	(I,91)
a	(I,90)
complete	(I,89)
educational	(I,88)
system	(I,87)
instead	(I,86)
of	(I,85)
financial	(I,84)
aid	(I,83)
.	(O,|)
In	(O,|)
addition	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
it	(O,|)
is	(O,|)
well	(O,|)
acknowledged	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
there	(O,|)
is	(O,|)
no	(O,|)
free	(O,|)
lunch	(O,|)
in	(O,|)
the	(O,|)
world	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
This	(O,|)
means	(O,|)
some	(P,45)
powerful	(I,44)
countries	(I,43)
provide	(I,42)
financial	(I,41)
support	(I,40)
in	(I,39)
order	(I,38)
to	(I,37)
acquire	(I,36)
the	(I,35)
right	(I,34)
to	(I,33)
exploit	(I,32)
the	(I,31)
local	(I,30)
resources	(I,29)
and	(I,28)
target	(I,27)
the	(I,26)
local	(I,25)
labour	(I,24)

.	(O,|)
Indeed	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
they	(P,19)
rarely	(I,18)
provide	(I,17)
local	(I,16)
residents	(I,15)

even	(I,9)
cause	(I,8)

Therefore	(O,|)

In	(O,|)
conclusion	(O,|)

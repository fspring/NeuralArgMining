Nowadays	(O,|)

we	(O,|)
are	(O,|)
living	(O,|)
in	(O,|)
in	(O,|)
the	(O,|)
world	(O,|)
which	(O,|)
is	(O,|)
absolutely	(O,|)
complicated	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
Everything	(O,|)
seem	(O,|)
to	(O,|)
be	(O,|)
rush	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
and	(O,|)
it	(O,|)
have	(O,|)
a	(O,|)
lot	(O,|)
of	(O,|)
competition	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
These	(O,|)
make	(O,|)
people	(O,|)
get	(O,|)
stress	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
Thus	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
many	(O,|)
people	(O,|)
try	(O,|)
to	(O,|)
reduce	(O,|)
their	(O,|)
stress	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
There	(O,|)
are	(O,|)
many	(O,|)
activities	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
could	(O,|)
relieve	(O,|)
those	(O,|)
people	(O,|)
who	(O,|)
are	(O,|)
in	(O,|)
stress	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
in	(O,|)
my	(O,|)
opinion	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
reducing	(C,77)
stress	(I,76)
by	(I,75)
listening	(I,74)
to	(I,73)
music	(I,72)
,	(I,71)
playing	(I,70)
sports	(I,69)
,	(I,68)
and	(I,67)
doing	(I,66)
meditation	(I,65)
are	(I,64)
easy	(I,63)
and	(I,62)
practical	(I,61)
ways	(I,60)
.	(O,|)
First	(O,|)
of	(O,|)
all	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
listening	(C,54)
to	(I,53)
music	(I,52)
is	(I,51)
a	(I,50)
great	(I,49)
way	(I,48)
to	(I,47)
relax	(I,46)
.	(O,|)
For	(O,|)
example	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
when	(O,|)
I	(O,|)
go	(O,|)
to	(O,|)
office	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
I	(O,|)
use	(O,|)
public	(O,|)
transport	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
I	(O,|)
see	(O,|)
many	(O,|)
things	(O,|)
such	(O,|)
as	(O,|)
traffic	(O,|)
jam	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
crowded	(O,|)
people	(O,|)
at	(O,|)
bus	(O,|)
stop	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
and	(O,|)
all	(O,|)
so	(O,|)
crowded	(O,|)
people	(O,|)
in	(O,|)
buses	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
These	(O,|)
make	(O,|)
me	(O,|)
stress	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
So	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
I	(P,234)
always	(I,233)
listen	(I,232)
music	(I,231)
from	(I,230)
my	(I,229)
mp3	(I,228)
player	(I,227)
.	(O,|)
I	(P,225)
could	(I,224)
enjoy	(I,223)
listening	(I,222)
music	(I,221)
without	(I,220)
thinking	(I,219)
of	(I,218)
people	(I,217)
around	(I,216)
me	(I,215)
.	(O,|)
Consequently	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
I	(P,211)
feel	(I,210)
happy	(I,209)
when	(I,208)
I	(I,207)
listen	(I,206)
music	(I,205)
.	(O,|)
Second	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
another	(C,58)
way	(I,57)
that	(I,56)
is	(I,55)
perfectly	(I,54)
work	(I,53)
for	(I,52)
everyone	(I,51)
to	(I,50)
reduce	(I,49)
the	(I,48)
stress	(I,47)
is	(I,46)
exercise	(I,45)
.	(O,|)
For	(O,|)
instance	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
I	(O,|)
alway	(O,|)
have	(O,|)
many	(O,|)
things	(O,|)
in	(O,|)
my	(O,|)
mind	(O,|)
such	(O,|)
as	(O,|)
a	(O,|)
difficult	(O,|)
of	(O,|)
my	(O,|)
work	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
I	(O,|)
have	(O,|)
to	(O,|)
finish	(O,|)
in	(O,|)
time	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
These	(O,|)
problem	(O,|)
sometime	(O,|)
make	(O,|)
me	(O,|)
hard	(O,|)
to	(O,|)
fall	(O,|)
asleep	(O,|)
because	(O,|)
it	(O,|)
make	(O,|)
me	(O,|)
stress	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
Thus	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
after	(P,143)
work	(I,142)
,	(I,141)
I	(I,140)
always	(I,139)
do	(I,138)
exercise	(I,137)

and	(I,135)
jogging	(I,134)
is	(I,133)
my	(I,132)
favorite	(I,131)
sport	(I,130)
.	(O,|)
I	(P,128)
feel	(I,127)
that	(I,126)
after	(I,125)
working	(I,124)
out	(I,123)
,	(I,122)
I	(I,121)
am	(I,120)
easily	(I,119)
to	(I,118)
fall	(I,117)
asleep	(I,116)
.	(O,|)
Exercising	(P,114)
not	(I,113)
only	(I,112)
reduce	(I,111)
my	(I,110)
stress	(I,109)

also	(I,107)
make	(I,106)
me	(I,105)
get	(I,104)
a	(I,103)
good	(I,102)

Third	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
meditation	(C,31)
also	(I,30)
one	(I,29)
of	(I,28)
the	(I,27)
ways	(I,26)
to	(I,25)
reduce	(I,24)
the	(I,23)
stress	(I,22)

when	(O,|)
I	(O,|)
have	(O,|)
many	(O,|)
things	(O,|)
to	(O,|)
think	(O,|)
about	(O,|)

and	(O,|)
this	(O,|)
make	(O,|)
me	(O,|)

I	(O,|)
will	(O,|)
do	(O,|)
meditation	(O,|)

Meditation	(P,66)
is	(I,65)
easy	(I,64)
way	(I,63)
to	(I,62)
relax	(I,61)
because	(O,|)
it	(P,59)
is	(I,58)
not	(I,57)
require	(I,56)
any	(I,55)
equipment	(I,54)

and	(I,52)
it	(I,51)
take	(I,50)
few	(I,49)
minutes	(I,48)

A	(P,46)
way	(I,45)
to	(I,44)
do	(I,43)
meditation	(I,42)
is	(I,41)
that	(I,40)
I	(I,39)
just	(I,38)

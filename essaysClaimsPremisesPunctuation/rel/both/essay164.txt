My	(O,|)
arguments	(O,|)
for	(O,|)
this	(O,|)
point	(O,|)
are	(O,|)
listed	(O,|)
follows	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
Firstly	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
training	(P,44)
time	(I,43)
can	(I,42)

Clearly	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
in	(P,27)
company	(I,26)
we	(I,25)
always	(I,24)
have	(I,23)
to	(I,22)
deal	(I,21)
with	(I,20)
so	(I,19)
many	(I,18)
stressful	(I,17)
situations	(I,16)
such	(I,15)
as	(I,14)
negotiating	(I,13)

customer	(I,10)
,	(I,9)
complaining	(I,8)
from	(I,7)
boss	(I,6)
,	(I,5)
etc	(I,4)
.	(O,|)
Therefore	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
we	(C,0)
can	(I,0)
unleash	(I,0)
uncomfortable	(I,0)

they	(I,28)
are	(I,27)

,	(O,|)
they	(P,147)
will	(I,146)
think	(I,145)
about	(I,144)

In	(O,|)

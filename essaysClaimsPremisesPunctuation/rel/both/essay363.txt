Some	(O,|)
people	(O,|)
think	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
this	(O,|)
is	(O,|)
a	(O,|)
positive	(O,|)

It	(O,|)
is	(O,|)
felt	(O,|)
by	(O,|)
many	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
the	(C,11)
usage	(I,10)
of	(I,9)
machines	(I,8)
is	(I,7)
harmful	(I,6)
for	(I,5)
health	(I,4)
of	(I,3)
humans	(I,2)
since	(O,|)
machines	(P,169)
decrease	(I,168)
the	(I,167)
work	(I,166)
done	(I,165)
by	(I,164)
people	(I,163)
.	(O,|)
For	(O,|)
example	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
in	(P,158)
many	(I,157)
institutions	(I,156)
staircases	(I,155)
are	(I,154)
replaced	(I,153)
by	(I,152)
lifts	(I,151)
now	(I,150)
a	(I,149)
days	(I,148)
.	(O,|)
People	(P,146)
opt	(I,145)
for	(I,144)
elevators	(I,143)
instead	(I,142)
of	(I,141)
climbing	(I,140)
one	(I,139)
or	(I,138)
two	(I,137)
flight	(I,136)

It	(P,132)
is	(I,131)
confirmed	(I,130)
in	(I,129)
a	(I,128)
number	(I,127)
of	(I,126)
researches	(I,125)
that	(I,124)
daily	(I,123)
usage	(I,122)
of	(I,121)
elevators	(I,120)
in	(I,119)
workplaces	(I,118)
promotes	(I,117)
obesity	(I,116)
.	(O,|)
So	(O,|)
this	(P,113)
example	(I,112)
clearly	(I,111)
shows	(I,110)
the	(I,109)
linkage	(I,108)
between	(I,107)

On	(O,|)
other	(O,|)
side	(O,|)
of	(O,|)
the	(O,|)
coin	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
many	(O,|)
people	(O,|)
believe	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
usage	(P,64)
of	(I,63)
machines	(I,62)
makes	(I,61)
work	(I,60)
easier	(I,59)
and	(I,58)
less	(I,57)
time	(I,56)
is	(I,55)
consumed	(I,54)
for	(I,53)
doing	(I,52)
similar	(I,51)
amount	(I,50)
of	(I,49)
work	(I,48)
.	(O,|)
Take	(P,46)
the	(I,45)
example	(I,44)
of	(I,43)
use	(I,42)
of	(I,41)
food	(I,40)
processors	(I,39)
in	(I,38)
kitchens	(I,37)
.	(O,|)
The	(P,35)
work	(I,34)
of	(I,33)
chopping	(I,32)
,	(I,31)
blending	(I,30)
,	(I,29)
grating	(I,28)
,	(I,27)
kneading	(I,26)
has	(I,25)
become	(I,24)
so	(I,23)
easy	(I,22)
that	(I,21)
people	(I,20)
can	(I,19)
not	(I,18)
imagine	(I,17)
their	(I,16)
lives	(I,15)
without	(I,14)
this	(I,13)
simple	(I,12)
machine	(I,11)
at	(I,10)
their	(I,9)
homes	(I,8)

Thus	(O,|)
it	(O,|)
is	(O,|)
very	(O,|)
obvious	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
using	(C,0)
machines	(I,0)
makes	(I,0)
daily	(I,0)
tasks	(I,0)
less	(I,0)
time	(I,0)
consuming	(I,0)
and	(I,0)
less	(I,0)
cumbersome	(I,0)
.	(O,|)
After	(O,|)
analyzing	(O,|)
these	(O,|)
two	(O,|)
points	(O,|)
of	(O,|)
view	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
it	(O,|)
is	(O,|)
believed	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
using	(C,25)
machines	(I,24)
is	(I,23)
advantageous	(I,22)
as	(O,|)
machines	(C,0)
make	(I,0)
work	(I,0)
easy	(I,0)
and	(I,0)
smooth	(I,0)
.	(O,|)
The	(C,13)
negative	(I,12)
effects	(I,11)
on	(I,10)
health	(I,9)
can	(I,8)
be	(I,7)
put	(I,6)
on	(I,5)
the	(I,4)
back	(I,3)
seat	(I,2)
because	(O,|)
there	(P,0)
are	(I,0)
many	(I,0)

ways	(I,0)

Therefore	(O,|)

it	(O,|)
is	(O,|)
hoped	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
in	(O,|)
coming	(O,|)

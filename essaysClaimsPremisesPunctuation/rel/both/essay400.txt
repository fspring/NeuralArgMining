completely	(O,|)
agree	(O,|)
with	(O,|)
the	(O,|)
idea	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
governments	(C,18)
should	(I,17)
devote	(I,16)
a	(I,15)
greater	(I,14)
portion	(I,13)

The	(P,55)

reason	(I,53)
why	(I,52)

measures	(I,48)
should	(I,47)
receive	(I,46)

the	(I,41)
potential	(I,40)

system	(I,36)

I	(O,|)
believe	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
decreasing	(P,31)
the	(I,30)
number	(I,29)

for	(I,6)
current	(I,5)
patients	(I,4)

Therefore	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
society	(C,12)
should	(I,11)
be	(I,10)
educated	(I,9)

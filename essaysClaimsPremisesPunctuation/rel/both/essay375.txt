true	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
the	(O,|)
increasing	(O,|)
number	(O,|)
of	(O,|)
languages	(O,|)
which	(O,|)
are	(O,|)
at	(O,|)
risk	(O,|)

many	(O,|)
people	(O,|)

today's	(O,|)

are	(O,|)
very	(O,|)
concerned	(O,|)
for	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
The	(O,|)
question	(O,|)
whether	(O,|)
our	(O,|)
government	(O,|)
should	(O,|)
make	(O,|)
an	(O,|)
effort	(O,|)
to	(O,|)
preserve	(O,|)
them	(O,|)
by	(O,|)
investing	(O,|)
more	(O,|)
money	(O,|)
on	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
minority	(O,|)
languages	(O,|)
or	(O,|)
not	(O,|)
is	(O,|)
still	(O,|)
a	(O,|)
debatable	(O,|)
one	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
I	(O,|)
personally	(O,|)
suppose	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
no	(C,36)
matter	(I,35)
how	(I,34)
widely	(I,33)
they	(I,32)
are	(I,31)
spoken	(I,30)
,	(I,29)
every	(I,28)
language	(I,27)
should	(I,26)
be	(I,25)
protected	(I,24)
from	(I,23)
being	(I,22)
disappeared	(I,21)
.	(O,|)
There	(O,|)
are	(O,|)
several	(O,|)
reasons	(O,|)
why	(O,|)
saving	(C,14)
regional	(I,13)
languages	(I,12)
could	(I,11)
be	(I,10)
seen	(I,9)
as	(I,8)
a	(I,7)
waste	(I,6)
of	(I,5)
money	(I,4)
.	(O,|)
Firstly	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
we	(P,254)
need	(I,253)
to	(I,252)
consider	(I,251)
that	(I,250)
if	(I,249)
the	(I,248)
government	(I,247)
expands	(I,246)
the	(I,245)
use	(I,244)
scope	(I,243)
of	(I,242)
that	(I,241)
languages	(I,240)
,	(I,239)
it	(I,238)
can	(I,237)
be	(I,236)
really	(I,235)
expensive	(I,234)
because	(O,|)
educational	(P,232)
programmes	(I,231)
will	(I,230)
need	(I,229)
to	(I,228)
be	(I,227)
given	(I,226)
so	(I,225)
as	(I,224)
to	(I,223)
keep	(I,222)
young	(I,221)
people	(I,220)
learning	(I,219)
and	(I,218)
using	(I,217)
them	(I,216)
.	(O,|)
For	(O,|)
example	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
some	(P,211)
certain	(I,210)
areas	(I,209)
in	(I,208)
the	(I,207)
Southern	(I,206)
Vietnam	(I,205)
have	(I,204)
been	(I,203)
trying	(I,202)
to	(I,201)
help	(I,200)
their	(I,199)
secondary	(I,198)
school	(I,197)
students	(I,196)
who	(I,195)
are	(I,194)
originally	(I,193)
from	(I,192)
khmer	(I,191)
people	(I,190)
speak	(I,189)
their	(I,188)
language	(I,187)
beside	(I,186)
Vietnamese	(I,185)
,	(O,|)
so	(O,|)
the	(P,182)
local	(I,181)
government	(I,180)
has	(I,179)
recently	(I,178)
struggled	(I,177)
with	(I,176)
their	(I,175)
costly	(I,174)
investments	(I,173)
on	(I,172)
language	(I,171)
teachers	(I,170)
,	(I,169)
facilities	(I,168)
and	(I,167)
appropriate	(I,166)
materials	(I,165)
.	(O,|)
Secondly	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
it	(O,|)
is	(O,|)
obvious	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
in	(C,0)
many	(I,0)
aspects	(I,0)
such	(I,0)
as	(I,0)
communication	(I,0)
,	(I,0)
trade	(I,0)
,	(I,0)
cooperation	(I,0)
as	(I,0)
well	(I,0)
as	(I,0)
transaction	(I,0)
,	(I,0)
it	(I,0)
will	(I,0)
be	(I,0)
absolutely	(I,0)
easier	(I,0)
for	(I,0)
the	(I,0)
whole	(I,0)
society	(I,0)
to	(I,0)
work	(I,0)
together	(I,0)
in	(I,0)
one	(I,0)
language	(I,0)
only	(I,0)
.	(O,|)
Despite	(O,|)
of	(O,|)
the	(O,|)
above	(O,|)
arguments	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
i	(O,|)
still	(O,|)
strongly	(O,|)
believe	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
the	(C,12)
government	(I,11)
should	(I,10)
try	(I,9)
to	(I,8)
preserve	(I,7)
minority	(I,6)
languages	(I,5)
.	(O,|)
This	(O,|)
is	(O,|)
because	(O,|)
language	(P,102)
can	(I,101)
be	(I,100)
seen	(I,99)
as	(I,98)
much	(I,97)
more	(I,96)
than	(I,95)
just	(I,94)
one	(I,93)
method	(I,92)
of	(I,91)
communication	(I,90)
.	(O,|)
In	(O,|)
addition	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
forming	(P,85)
a	(I,84)
language	(I,83)
must	(I,82)
be	(I,81)
undergone	(I,80)
thousands	(I,79)
of	(I,78)
years	(I,77)
;	(O,|)
thus	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
it	(P,73)
deserves	(I,72)
to	(I,71)
be	(I,70)
respected	(I,69)
and	(I,68)
preserved	(I,67)
.	(O,|)
Last	(O,|)
but	(O,|)
not	(O,|)
least	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
language	(P,60)
is	(I,59)
one	(I,58)
of	(I,57)
the	(I,56)
essential	(I,55)
factors	(I,54)
creating	(I,53)
the	(I,52)
differences	(I,51)
and	(I,50)
unique	(I,49)
cutures	(I,48)
in	(I,47)
the	(I,46)
world	(I,45)
.	(O,|)
Therefore	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
saving	(P,41)
the	(I,40)
use	(I,39)
of	(I,38)
that	(I,37)
kinds	(I,36)
of	(I,35)
languages	(I,34)
in	(I,33)
this	(I,32)
case	(I,31)
generally	(I,30)
is	(I,29)
the	(I,28)
most	(I,27)
important	(I,26)
element	(I,25)
of	(I,24)
the	(I,23)
cultural	(I,22)
diversity's	(I,21)
preservation	(I,20)
.	(O,|)
In	(O,|)
conclusion	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
although	(O,|)
letting	(C,0)
languages	(I,0)
spoken	(I,0)
by	(I,0)
ethnic	(I,0)

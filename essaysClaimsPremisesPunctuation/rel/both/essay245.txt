Although	(O,|)
many	(O,|)
people	(O,|)
prefer	(O,|)
communicating	(O,|)
by	(O,|)
telephone	(O,|)
or	(O,|)
face-to-face	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
personally	(O,|)
I	(O,|)
believe	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
communicating	(C,35)
by	(I,34)
e-mails	(I,33)
or	(I,32)
voice	(I,31)
mails	(I,30)
is	(I,29)
better	(I,28)
.	(O,|)
There	(O,|)
are	(O,|)
several	(O,|)
reasons	(O,|)
to	(O,|)
support	(O,|)
this	(O,|)
idea	(O,|)
which	(O,|)
I	(O,|)
would	(O,|)
like	(O,|)
to	(O,|)
mention	(O,|)
in	(O,|)
this	(O,|)
essay	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
Firstly	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
communicating	(C,6)
by	(I,5)
e-mail	(I,4)
is	(I,3)
easy	(I,2)
.	(O,|)
Many	(P,261)
people	(I,260)
have	(I,259)
problems	(I,258)
with	(I,257)
calling	(I,256)
a	(I,255)
person	(I,254)
that	(I,253)
they	(I,252)
are	(I,251)
not	(I,250)
acquainted	(I,249)
with	(I,248)
.	(O,|)
In	(P,246)
this	(I,245)
case	(I,244)
it	(I,243)
is	(I,242)
not	(I,241)
so	(I,240)
difficult	(I,239)
to	(I,238)
write	(I,237)
an	(I,236)
e-mail	(I,235)
or	(I,234)
to	(I,233)
leave	(I,232)
a	(I,231)
voice	(I,230)
mail	(I,229)
because	(O,|)
even	(P,227)
shy	(I,226)
people	(I,225)
feel	(I,224)
themselves	(I,223)
more	(I,222)
confident	(I,221)
.	(O,|)
Secondly	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
you	(C,16)
can	(I,15)
write	(I,14)
an	(I,13)
e-mail	(I,12)
at	(I,11)
any	(I,10)
time	(I,9)
of	(I,8)
the	(I,7)
day	(I,6)
.	(O,|)
As	(O,|)
for	(O,|)
me	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
I	(P,201)
work	(I,200)
and	(I,199)
study	(I,198)
at	(I,197)
the	(I,196)
university	(I,195)
and	(I,194)
I	(I,193)
don't	(I,192)
have	(I,191)
spare	(I,190)
time	(I,189)
during	(I,188)
the	(I,187)
day	(I,186)
.	(O,|)
I	(P,184)
get	(I,183)
home	(I,182)
at	(I,181)
about	(I,180)
midnight	(I,179)
and	(I,178)
I	(I,177)
still	(I,176)
need	(I,175)
to	(I,174)
answer	(I,173)
some	(I,172)
questions	(I,171)
and	(I,170)
to	(I,169)
solve	(I,168)
some	(I,167)
routine	(I,166)
problems	(I,165)
.	(O,|)
I	(P,21)
might	(I,20)
not	(I,19)
have	(I,18)
time	(I,17)
to	(I,16)
call	(I,15)
a	(I,14)
person	(I,13)
or	(I,12)
to	(I,11)
meet	(I,10)
with	(I,9)
him	(I,8)
or	(I,7)
her	(I,6)
in	(I,5)
an	(I,4)
appropriate	(I,3)
time	(I,2)
so	(O,|)
for	(P,142)
me	(I,141)
it	(I,140)
is	(I,139)
better	(I,138)
to	(I,137)
leave	(I,136)
a	(I,135)
voice	(I,134)
mail	(I,133)
.	(O,|)
Thirdly	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
when	(C,30)
you	(I,29)
write	(I,28)
an	(I,27)
e-mail	(I,26)
you	(I,25)
have	(I,24)
enough	(I,23)
time	(I,22)
to	(I,21)
think	(I,20)
carefully	(I,19)
about	(I,18)
what	(I,17)
you	(I,16)
are	(I,15)
writing	(I,14)
and	(I,13)
how	(I,12)
it	(I,11)
would	(I,10)
be	(I,9)
better	(I,8)
to	(I,7)
express	(I,6)
yourself	(I,5)
.	(O,|)
For	(O,|)
example	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
you	(P,99)
can	(I,98)
change	(I,97)
the	(I,96)
word	(I,95)
order	(I,94)
or	(I,93)
you	(I,92)
can	(I,91)
choose	(I,90)
more	(I,89)
appropriate	(I,88)
style	(I,87)
to	(I,86)
sound	(I,85)
more	(I,84)
polite	(I,83)
.	(O,|)
When	(P,81)
you	(I,80)
speak	(I,79)
face-to-face	(I,78)
you	(I,77)
are	(I,76)
not	(I,75)
as	(I,74)
able	(I,73)
to	(I,72)
control	(I,71)
every	(I,70)
word	(I,69)
as	(I,68)
you	(I,67)
are	(I,66)
when	(I,65)
you	(I,64)
write	(I,63)
an	(I,62)
e-mail	(I,61)
.	(O,|)
And	(O,|)
finally	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
there	(C,13)
is	(I,12)
no	(I,11)
chance	(I,10)
to	(I,9)
disturb	(I,8)
people	(I,7)
by	(I,6)
sending	(I,5)
them	(I,4)
an	(I,3)
e-mail	(I,2)
.	(O,|)
You	(P,43)
should	(I,42)
not	(I,41)
worry	(I,40)
about	(I,39)
interrupting	(I,38)
an	(I,37)
important	(I,36)
conversation	(I,35)
or	(I,34)
some	(I,33)
other	(I,32)
business	(I,31)
.	(O,|)
To	(O,|)
sum	(O,|)
up	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
I	(O,|)
would	(O,|)
like	(O,|)
to	(O,|)
say	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
for	(O,|)
me	(O,|)
both	(O,|)
options	(O,|)
of	(O,|)
communicating	(O,|)
are	(O,|)
possible	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
but	(O,|)
if	(O,|)
this	(O,|)
is	(O,|)
an	(O,|)
important	(O,|)
and	(O,|)
not	(O,|)
urgent	(O,|)
question	(O,|)
I	(C,0)

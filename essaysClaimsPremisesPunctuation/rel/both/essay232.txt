I	(O,|)
completely	(O,|)
agree	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
parents	(C,42)
are	(I,41)
the	(I,40)
best	(I,39)
teacher	(I,38)
.	(O,|)
Children	(C,0)
normally	(I,0)
think	(I,0)
that	(I,0)
their	(I,0)
parents	(I,0)
are	(I,0)
somehow	(I,0)
special	(I,0)
and	(I,0)
that	(I,0)
makes	(I,0)
them	(I,0)
the	(I,0)
most	(I,0)
important	(I,0)
people	(I,0)
in	(I,0)
the	(I,0)
children’s	(I,0)
lives	(I,0)
.	(O,|)
Firstly	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
the	(C,12)
things	(I,11)
that	(I,10)
parents	(I,9)
say	(I,8)
have	(I,7)
great	(I,6)
power	(I,5)
to	(I,4)
their	(I,3)
child	(I,2)
.	(O,|)
More	(P,171)
power	(I,170)
than	(I,169)
any	(I,168)
friend	(I,167)
or	(I,166)
other	(I,165)
adult	(I,164)
could	(I,163)
have	(I,162)
.	(O,|)
For	(O,|)
example	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
if	(P,157)
someone	(I,156)
tells	(I,155)
a	(I,154)
kid	(I,153)
that	(I,152)
something	(I,151)
is	(I,150)
wrong	(I,149)
and	(I,148)
they	(I,147)
shouldn't	(I,146)
do	(I,145)
it	(I,144)
,	(I,143)
but	(I,142)
his	(I,141)
father	(I,140)
told	(I,139)
him/her	(I,138)
that	(I,137)
it	(I,136)
was	(I,135)
right	(I,134)
,	(I,133)
the	(I,132)
kid	(I,131)
will	(I,130)
listen	(I,129)
to	(I,128)
the	(I,127)
father	(I,126)
instead	(I,125)
of	(I,124)
the	(I,123)
other	(I,122)
person	(I,121)
,	(I,120)
even	(I,119)
if	(I,118)
his	(I,117)
father	(I,116)
is	(I,115)
wrong	(I,114)
.	(O,|)
Secondly	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
a	(P,15)
child	(I,14)
normally	(I,13)
spends	(I,12)
more	(I,11)
time	(I,10)
with	(I,9)
their	(I,8)
parents	(I,7)
than	(I,6)
with	(I,5)
other	(I,4)
people	(I,3)
,	(O,|)
so	(O,|)
their	(C,12)
parents	(I,11)
have	(I,10)
more	(I,9)
time	(I,8)
to	(I,7)
teach	(I,6)
him/her	(I,5)
than	(I,4)
anybody	(I,3)
else	(I,2)
.	(O,|)
They	(P,83)
have	(I,82)
more	(I,81)
contact	(I,80)
and	(I,79)
more	(I,78)
intimacy	(I,77)
with	(I,76)
their	(I,75)
children	(I,74)
.	(O,|)
Lastly	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
children	(C,13)
usually	(I,12)
mirror	(I,11)
themselves	(I,10)
on	(I,9)
their	(I,8)
parents	(I,7)
.	(O,|)
That’s	(O,|)
as	(O,|)
important	(O,|)
thing	(O,|)
because	(O,|)
even	(P,57)
if	(I,56)
the	(I,55)
parents	(I,54)
don’t	(I,53)
intend	(I,52)
to	(I,51)
teach	(I,50)
their	(I,49)
children	(I,48)
something	(I,47)
,	(I,46)
they	(I,45)
are	(I,44)
always	(I,43)
observing	(I,42)
and	(I,41)
learning	(I,40)
by	(I,39)
themselves	(I,38)
.	(O,|)
So	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
if	(P,34)
there	(I,33)
is	(I,32)
a	(I,31)
man	(I,30)
that	(I,29)
beats	(I,28)
his	(I,27)
wife	(I,26)
and	(I,25)
treats	(I,24)
her	(I,23)
bad	(I,22)
,	(I,21)
his	(I,20)
child	(I,19)
probably	(I,18)
is	(I,17)
going	(I,16)
to	(I,15)
be	(I,14)
rude	(I,13)
and	(I,12)
treat	(I,11)
girls	(I,10)
bad	(I,9)
.	(O,|)
All	(O,|)
in	(O,|)
all	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
I	(O,|)
agree	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
parents	(C,0)
are	(I,0)
the	(I,0)
greatest	(I,0)
teachers	(I,0)
and	(O,|)
I	(O,|)
think	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
they	(O,|)
should	(O,|)
be	(O,|)
very	(O,|)
careful	(O,|)
with	(O,|)
what	(O,|)
they	(O,|)
say	(O,|)
and	(O,|)
do	(O,|)
in	(O,|)
front	(O,|)
of	(O,|)
their	(O,|)
child	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
because	(O,|)
it	(O,|)
can	(O,|)
define	(O,|)
who	(O,|)
he	(O,|)
is	(O,|)
going	(O,|)
to	(O,|)
be	(O,|)
.	(O,|)

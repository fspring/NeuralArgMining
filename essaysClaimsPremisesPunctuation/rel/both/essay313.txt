Pets	(O,|)
have	(O,|)
always	(O,|)
been	(O,|)
essential	(O,|)
in	(O,|)
our	(O,|)
society	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
Cats	(O,|)
and	(O,|)
dogs	(O,|)
are	(O,|)
the	(O,|)
most	(O,|)
common	(O,|)
pets	(O,|)
but	(O,|)
there	(O,|)
are	(O,|)
birds	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
tortoises	(O,|)
and	(O,|)
fishes	(O,|)
as	(O,|)
well	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
Some	(O,|)
people	(O,|)
think	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
pets	(O,|)
should	(O,|)
be	(O,|)
treated	(O,|)
like	(O,|)
family	(O,|)
members	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
However	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
others	(O,|)
argue	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
they	(O,|)
are	(O,|)
just	(O,|)
animals	(O,|)
and	(O,|)
aren't	(O,|)
able	(O,|)
to	(O,|)
think	(O,|)
like	(O,|)
us	(O,|)

The	(O,|)
issue	(O,|)
is	(O,|)
controversial	(O,|)
but	(O,|)
in	(O,|)
my	(O,|)
opinion	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
pets	(C,25)
should	(I,24)
be	(I,23)
treated	(I,22)
like	(I,21)
human	(I,20)
beings	(I,19)
for	(O,|)
different	(O,|)
reasons	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
First	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
pets	(C,12)
are	(I,11)
our	(I,10)
friends	(I,9)
as	(I,8)
well	(I,7)
as	(I,6)
certain	(I,5)
human	(I,4)
beings	(I,3)
are	(I,2)
.	(O,|)
Similarly	(P,253)
to	(I,252)
friends	(I,251)
,	(I,250)
indeed	(I,249)
,	(I,248)
they	(I,247)
are	(I,246)
always	(I,245)
with	(I,244)
us	(I,243)
and	(I,242)
they	(I,241)
are	(I,240)
there	(I,239)
if	(I,238)
we	(I,237)
feel	(I,236)
alone	(I,235)
.	(O,|)
We	(P,233)
can	(I,232)
talk	(I,231)
to	(I,230)
them	(I,229)
because	(O,|)
they	(P,26)
listen	(I,25)
to	(I,24)
us	(I,23)
,	(I,22)
more	(I,21)
than	(I,20)
some	(I,19)
people	(I,18)
will	(I,17)
ever	(I,16)
do	(I,15)
.	(O,|)
To	(O,|)
illustrate	(O,|)
this	(O,|)
point	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
I	(O,|)
can	(O,|)
write	(O,|)
about	(O,|)
my	(O,|)
own	(O,|)
experience	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
When	(P,201)
I	(I,200)
was	(I,199)
14	(I,198)
years	(I,197)
old	(I,196)
,	(I,195)
my	(I,194)
uncle	(I,193)
passed	(I,192)
away	(I,191)
and	(I,190)
I	(I,189)
felt	(I,188)
like	(I,187)
everything	(I,186)
was	(I,185)
no	(I,184)
longer	(I,183)
important	(I,182)
.	(O,|)
Talking	(P,180)
to	(I,179)
my	(I,178)
friends	(I,177)
was	(I,176)
frustrating	(I,175)
because	(O,|)
none	(P,173)
of	(I,172)
them	(I,171)
have	(I,170)
ever	(I,169)
felt	(I,168)
that	(I,167)
way	(I,166)
.	(O,|)
Since	(O,|)
I	(P,11)
was	(I,10)
all	(I,9)
alone	(I,8)
at	(I,7)
home	(I,6)
for	(I,5)
a	(I,4)
long	(I,3)
time	(I,2)
,	(O,|)
my	(P,152)
dog	(I,151)
was	(I,150)
near	(I,149)
me	(I,148)
and	(I,147)
it	(I,146)
seemed	(I,145)
to	(I,144)
me	(I,143)
that	(I,142)
only	(I,141)
him	(I,140)
could	(I,139)
understand	(I,138)
my	(I,137)
deeply	(I,136)
feelings	(I,135)
.	(O,|)
Clearly	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
although	(O,|)
pets	(P,130)
aren't	(I,129)
able	(I,128)
to	(I,127)
speak	(I,126)
with	(I,125)
us	(I,124)

we	(P,122)
can	(I,121)
nonetheless	(I,120)
count	(I,119)
on	(I,118)
them	(I,117)

Secondly	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
pets	(C,12)
are	(I,11)
useful	(I,10)
for	(I,9)
a	(I,8)
variety	(I,7)
of	(I,6)
things	(I,5)

For	(O,|)
example	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
nowadays	(P,101)
the	(I,100)
pet	(I,99)
therapy	(I,98)
is	(I,97)
becoming	(I,96)
more	(I,95)
popular	(I,94)
than	(I,93)
before	(I,92)
.	(O,|)
Researchers	(P,90)
have	(I,89)
discovered	(I,88)
that	(I,87)
pets	(I,86)
can	(I,85)
bring	(I,84)
benefits	(I,83)
in	(I,82)
a	(I,81)
huge	(I,80)
amount	(I,79)
of	(I,78)
illnesses	(I,77)

There	(P,12)
are	(I,11)
dogs	(I,10)
who	(I,9)
lead	(I,8)
blind	(I,7)
people	(I,6)
around	(I,5)
the	(I,4)
city	(I,3)
and	(O,|)
therefore	(O,|)
without	(P,63)
them	(I,62)

could	(I,60)
not	(I,59)
go	(I,58)
around	(I,57)
all	(I,56)
alone	(I,55)

In	(O,|)

pets	(P,50)
are	(I,49)
important	(I,48)
for	(I,47)
depressed	(I,46)
people	(I,45)

better	(I,36)

Some	(O,|)
people	(O,|)
think	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
mass	(O,|)
media	(O,|)
should	(O,|)
only	(O,|)
focus	(O,|)
on	(O,|)
news	(O,|)
and	(O,|)
current	(O,|)
affairs	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
Others	(O,|)
believe	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
television	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
newspapers	(O,|)
and	(O,|)
magazines	(O,|)
should	(O,|)
keep	(O,|)
us	(O,|)
entertained	(O,|)
and	(O,|)
therefore	(O,|)
they	(O,|)
should	(O,|)
pay	(O,|)
attention	(O,|)
to	(O,|)
famous	(O,|)
people	(O,|)
lives	(O,|)
as	(O,|)
well	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
This	(O,|)
issue	(O,|)
is	(O,|)
a	(O,|)
controversial	(O,|)
one	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
but	(O,|)
in	(O,|)
my	(O,|)
opinion	(O,|)
a	(O,|)
closer	(O,|)
examination	(O,|)
reveals	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
mass	(C,33)
media	(I,32)
deal	(I,31)
too	(I,30)
much	(I,29)
with	(I,28)
superficial	(I,27)
things	(I,26)
for	(O,|)
different	(O,|)
reasons	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
One	(O,|)
reason	(O,|)
is	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
television	(C,17)
and	(I,16)
newspapers	(I,15)
focus	(I,14)
on	(I,13)
famous	(I,12)
peoples'	(I,11)
lives	(I,10)
in	(I,9)
order	(I,8)
to	(I,7)
increase	(I,6)
their	(I,5)
audience	(I,4)
or	(I,3)
readership	(I,2)
.	(O,|)
Gutter	(P,154)
press	(I,153)
and	(I,152)
Tabloid	(I,151)
TV	(I,150)
are	(I,149)
more	(I,148)
and	(I,147)
more	(I,146)
replacing	(I,145)
quality	(I,144)
papers	(I,143)
or	(I,142)
documentaries	(I,141)
programs	(I,140)
.	(O,|)
Thanks	(P,138)
to	(I,137)
the	(I,136)
Internet	(I,135)
,	(I,134)
we	(I,133)
can	(I,132)
go	(I,131)
online	(I,130)
and	(I,129)
have	(I,128)
access	(I,127)
to	(I,126)
information	(I,125)
from	(I,124)
all	(I,123)
over	(I,122)
the	(I,121)
world	(I,120)
and	(O,|)
therefore	(O,|)
mass	(P,117)
media	(I,116)
don't	(I,115)
need	(I,114)
any	(I,113)
more	(I,112)
to	(I,111)
keep	(I,110)
informed	(I,109)
people	(I,108)
but	(I,107)
their	(I,106)
goal	(I,105)
is	(I,104)
to	(I,103)
have	(I,102)
enough	(I,101)
readers	(I,100)
or	(I,99)
TV	(I,98)
audience	(I,97)
.	(O,|)
Another	(O,|)
reason	(O,|)
is	(O,|)
that	(O,|)
we	(C,15)
live	(I,14)
in	(I,13)
a	(I,12)
society	(I,11)
where	(I,10)
the	(I,9)
most	(I,8)
important	(I,7)
thing	(I,6)
is	(I,5)
appearance	(I,4)
and	(I,3)
gossip	(I,2)

Nowadays	(P,76)

while	(I,64)
they	(I,63)
are	(I,62)

.	(O,|)
Newspapers	(P,57)
often	(I,56)
receive	(I,55)
accusations	(I,54)
of	(I,53)
checkbook	(I,52)
journalism	(I,51)
;	(I,50)
this	(I,49)
means	(I,48)
that	(I,47)
magazines	(I,46)
pay	(I,45)
people	(I,44)
a	(I,43)
lot	(I,42)
of	(I,41)

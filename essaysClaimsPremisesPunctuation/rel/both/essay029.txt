their	(I,0)
household	(I,0)
.	(O,|)
I	(O,|)
will	(O,|)
mention	(O,|)
some	(O,|)
basic	(O,|)
reasons	(O,|)
as	(O,|)
following	(O,|)
.	(O,|)
Firstly	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
extra	(P,55)
income	(I,54)
that	(I,53)
women	(I,52)
earn	(I,51)
will	(I,50)
contribute	(I,49)
to	(I,48)
their	(I,47)
family's	(I,46)
expenses	(I,45)
.	(O,|)
By	(P,43)
taking	(I,42)
up	(I,41)
a	(I,40)
job	(I,39)
,	(I,38)
a	(I,37)
wife	(I,36)
can	(I,35)
earn	(I,34)
more	(I,33)
money	(I,32)
to	(I,31)
support	(I,30)
her	(I,29)
family	(I,28)
life	(I,27)
.	(O,|)
This	(P,25)
is	(I,24)
really	(I,23)
necessary	(I,22)
in	(I,21)
cases	(I,20)
of	(I,19)
her	(I,18)
husband's	(I,17)
low	(I,16)
salary	(I,15)
and	(I,14)
the	(I,13)
difficulty	(I,12)
of	(I,11)
getting	(I,10)
a	(I,9)
good	(I,8)

house	(I,46)
creates	(I,45)
opportunities	(I,44)
for	(I,43)
married	(I,42)
women	(I,41)
to	(I,40)
contact	(I,39)
with	(I,38)
the	(I,37)
outer	(I,36)
world	(I,35)
,	(I,34)
strengthen	(I,33)
their	(I,32)
character	(I,31)
and	(I,30)
show	(I,29)
their	(I,28)
capacity	(I,27)
.	(O,|)
These	(P,25)
things	(I,24)
in	(I,23)
turn	(I,22)
will	(I,21)
make	(I,20)
them	(I,19)

Therefore	(O,|)

Last	(O,|)
but	(O,|)
not	(O,|)

,	(O,|)
nowadays	(O,|)
,	(O,|)
there	(C,13)
